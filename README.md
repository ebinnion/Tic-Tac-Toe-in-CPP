Tic-Tac-Toe-in-CPP
==================

This is an ugly but functional tic tac toe game in C++ using console input that was created to audition for an apprenticeship with 8th light. This was built using Xcode on Mac OS x 10.7.3.

Looking at this code that was done in Spring of 2012, and comparing it to current work, you can see how much growth I have had.

This project will likely not be updated, but will be left up to compare future work to.
